Activation-Aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) calibration for Squish.

AWQ improves INT8 quantization accuracy by protecting the ~1% of weight
channels that are most sensitive to quantization error.  Those channels are
identified by large activation magnitudes — high |x[c]| means any quantization
error in W[:,c] gets amplified at the output.

Algorithm (Lin et al., 2023  https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978):
  1. Run a calibration set through the model.
  2. For each linear layer, collect per-input-channel activation magnitudes.
  3. Compute per-channel scale:  s[c] = mean_act[c] ** alpha    (alpha ≈ 0.5)
  4. Before quantization: W_awq[:, c] /= s[c]
     The input rescaling (X_awq[c] = X[c] * s[c]) is absorbed into the
     previous LayerNorm's gamma:  gamma_awq[c] = gamma[c] * s[c]

Net effect: salient channels are moved into a tighter range that INT8 can
represent accurately — typically +0.5-2% accuracy on MMLU / HellaSwag.

Usage
-----
Calibration (needs the FP16 model loaded):

    python3 -m squish.quant.awq \\
        --model-dir ~/models/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-bf16 \\
        --output    ~/models/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-bf16/awq_scales \\
        --n-samples 128 \\
        --alpha 0.5

Then pass scales to squish.convert:

    python3 -m squish.convert \\
        --model-dir ~/models/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-bf16 \\
        --output    ~/models/squish_7b \\
        --awq-scales ~/models/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-bf16/awq_scales

Or apply programmatically before quantizing a weight dict:

    from squish.quant.awq import load_awq_scales, apply_awq_to_weights
    scales = load_awq_scales(awq_dir)
    weights = apply_awq_to_weights(weights, scales)

    """
    Apply pre-computed AWQ scales to a flat weight dict before quantization.

    ``weights`` maps tensor names (e.g. ``model.layers.0.self_attn.q_proj.weight``)
    to float32 numpy arrays.

    For each matched linear layer weight W (shape out × in), the scale is
    applied column-wise per the AWQ paper (Lin et al., 2023 §3.2)::

        W_awq[:, c] = W[:, c] * s[c]         (multiply  — weight channel amplified)
        gamma_awq[c] = gamma[c] / s[c]       (divide    — LN gamma attenuated)

    This preserves the mathematical identity  ``(X / s) @ (W * s).T = X @ W.T``
    while improving INT4 precision: salient input channels (large ``s[c]``) get
    larger weight values → occupy more of the INT4 quantization range → smaller
    relative quantization error where it matters most.

    **Grouping rule**: only layers whose input is DIRECTLY a LayerNorm output
    are processed (q/k/v projections and gate/up MLP projections).  Layers
    whose input comes from something else (o_proj receives attention output;
    down_proj receives gate*up) are skipped because their scale cannot be
    absorbed into a preceding norm without distorting the output.

    For each LayerNorm that feeds multiple projections (e.g. q, k, v all share
    ``input_layernorm``), a SINGLE group scale is computed as the channel-wise
    mean across all members.  The LayerNorm is updated exactly once with this
    group scale, guaranteeing the identity
    ``(X / s) @ (W * s).T = X @ W.T`` for every member.

    Parameters

    """
    Pre-compute per-tensor AWQ operations from calibration scales.

    This is the **streaming-safe** entry point for AWQ application.  It
    groups per-layer activation scales into attention and MLP blocks,
    computes one group-average scale per block, and returns two lookup
    tables that can be applied one tensor at a time:

    proj_apply : layer_path → group_scale  (np.ndarray)
        For each linear projection weight (q/k/v, gate/up):
        ``W_awq[:, c] = W[:, c] * group_scale[c]``   ← MULTIPLY (amplify salient channels)

    ln_apply   : full_tensor_name → group_scale  (np.ndarray)
        For the LayerNorm that feeds each group:
        ``gamma_awq[c] = gamma[c] / group_scale[c]``  ← DIVIDE  (attenuate LN output)
        Each LayerNorm name appears at most once.

    The two operations together preserve the identity
    ``(X / s) @ (W * s).T = X @ W.T`` for every member, so the model
    output is mathematically equivalent in BF16.  Under INT4 quantization,
    salient channels (large ``s``) now have large weight values that occupy
    more of the quantization range  → smaller relative quantization error
    for the channels that matter most.

    Note: o_proj and down_proj are intentionally excluded — their inputs
    are not LayerNorm outputs, so no inverse compensation is possible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    awq_scales  : output of :func:`collect_activation_scales` / :func:`load_awq_scales`
                  Keys are layer paths, e.g. ``"model.layers.0.self_attn.q_proj"``.
