ModelPool — Hot model pool with lazy loading and LRU eviction.

In multi-model serving, keeping all models resident in memory simultaneously
is impractical.  A hot pool keeps the most recently used (MRU) models ready,
evicting the least recently used (LRU) model when adding a new one would
exceed the configured memory capacity.

Models must first be registered with their size before they can be acquired.
:meth:`ModelPool.acquire` bumps an active reference count so that an in-use
model is never evicted mid-request.  Callers must call :meth:`ModelPool.release`
when they are finished with a model.

Example usage::

    from squish.model_pool import ModelPool, PoolEntry

    pool = ModelPool(capacity_mb=8192.0)
    pool.register("llama-3-8b", size_mb=4096.0)
    pool.register("llama-3-70b", size_mb=35000.0)
    pool.register("phi-3-mini", size_mb=2048.0)

    entry = pool.acquire("llama-3-8b")
    print(f"loaded={pool.loaded_models}, util={pool.utilization:.1%}")
    pool.release("llama-3-8b")

    evicted = pool.evict_lru()
    print(f"evicted={evicted!r}, stats={pool.stats}")
