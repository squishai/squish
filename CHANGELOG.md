## [58.0.0] — Wave 85 — 2026-03-25

### Refactor — Terminal Palette Consolidation

#### 1. Deduplicate Palette System (`cli.py`, `server.py` → `_term.py`)

- **Before**: Three separate copies of the terminal colour-detection and palette
  code existed: `squish/_term.py` (canonical), `squish/cli.py:128–217`, and
  `squish/server.py:540–651`. On terminals with custom colour profiles (Solarized,
  Nord, Dracula) where `COLORFGBG` is unset, the three copies could render
  differently because the duplicate detection logic was not kept in sync with the
  canonical version's `_BG_CONFIRMED` guard.
- **After**: `cli.py` and `server.py` both import `C`, `gradient`, and `LOGO_GRAD`
  directly from `squish._term`. All palette selection (`_Palette` dark 24-bit /
  `_PaletteLight` light 24-bit / `_PaletteANSI` terminal-native ANSI fallback)
  is now handled exclusively in `_term.py`. This guarantees consistent colours
  across all entry-points.
- **Env vars respected (single location)**: `NO_COLOR`, `SQUISH_DARK_BG`,
  `COLORFGBG`, `FORCE_COLOR`, `COLORTERM`. When background is unconfirmed,
  `_PaletteANSI` is used so the terminal's own colour profile is respected
  (standard `\033[35m` codes, not hardcoded RGB).
- **Lines removed**: ~110 lines from `cli.py`, ~115 lines from `server.py`.

#### 2. Fix Hardcoded Port in `v1_router.py`

- Default `server_url` in `OpenAPISchemaBuilder` and `V1Router.openapi_schema()`
  was hardcoded to `http://localhost:11434` (Ollama's port). Changed to use
  module-level `_DEFAULT_SERVER_URL = os.environ.get("SQUISH_SERVER_URL",
  "http://localhost:11435")` so it respects env-var overrides.

### Documentation — README Accuracy

#### 3. README Accuracy Pass

- **macOS menu bar app** row: changed from "Coming soon" → ✅ (SquishBar at
  `apps/macos/SquishBar/` is functional).
- **Model count**: updated `29 available models` → `34 available models`
  throughout Quick Start section.
- **SquishBar mention**: removed "*(coming soon)*" annotation.
- **Ollama compat table**: added `/api/pull` and `/api/ps` rows with
  descriptive footnote (catalog-backed pull, Wave 88 for full `/api/ps`).

---

## [51.0.0] — Wave 78 — 2026-03-24

### Performance — Module-load & RadixTree Lazy Init

#### 1. RadixTree Lazy Initialisation (`server.py`)

- **Before**: `from squish.kv.radix_cache import RadixTree as _RadixTree` ran at
  module level, paying ~16 ms of import cost every time `import squish.server`
  was executed (CLI, tests, benchmarks).
- **After**: The import is deferred into `_init_prefix_cache()`. The function is
  called automatically on first use (at server startup via `_print_optimization_status`,
  and via null-guards in `_generate_tokens` and the `/v1/metrics` endpoint).
  `_PrefixCache` is exposed via module `__getattr__` for backward-compat test
  access before explicit init.
- **Impact**: Saves ~16 ms from `import squish.server`. All existing tests
  pass unchanged — the test suite patches `_prefix_cache` via `patch.multiple`
  which works the same with lazy init.

### Quantisation Quality — INT2/INT3

#### 2. HQQ Pre-Optimisation Pass (`squish quantize --hqq`)

- **New flag**: `squish quantize --hqq` enables Half-Quadratic Quantization
  pre-processing for FFN weights before mlx_lm.convert runs.
- **Mechanism**: `_preoptimize_weights_with_hqq()` loads each BF16 safetensors
  shard, applies HQQ `encode → decode` to all `gate_proj / up_proj / down_proj`
  weights, writes float-optimised shards to a temp directory, then calls
  `mlx_lm.convert` on the temp directory. Because the weights are already
  aligned to the HQQ-optimal quantisation grid, mlx_lm's naive rounding
  achieves the same quality as full HQQ (without requiring custom packed weight
  formats).
- **Quality improvement**: For INT2 (4 quantisation levels per group), HQQ
  typically reduces relative reconstruction error by 40–60% compared to naive
  round-to-nearest. For INT3 it improves SNR by 4–8 dB.
- **Constraint**: Requires a local BF16 source directory (not a HF model ID).
  Adds 1–3 minutes for a 7B model on Apple Silicon.

#### 3. Auto-Tighten `group_size` for INT2

- When `--ffn-bits 2` is specified and the user has not explicitly set
  `--group-size`, the default of 64 is automatically tightened to 32.
- 2× more scale/zero parameters at ~2% model size overhead; significantly better
  INT2 reconstruction quality. Documented in output with an override hint.

#### 4. Small-Model Quality Warning

- `squish quantize --ffn-bits 2` on a model <1 B parameters now prints a
  calibrated warning: *"expect ~35% MMLU (random-chance level)"*. Users of
  INT2 on small models are directed toward INT3/INT4.

### New Command — `squish check`

- `squish check --model PATH` inspects a quantized model directory and reports:
  - Detected bits and group_size per layer type (FFN / attention / embed)
  - Theoretical reconstruction quality (SNR dB) via HQQ simulation on
    synthetic weights — no model weights loaded into RAM
  - Calibrated warnings for problematic configs: INT2 with large groups,
    unprotected INT2 attention projections, small models at extreme bit-width
  - Tip pointing to `--hqq` and `--attn-bits 4` for INT2

### Testing

- 25 new tests in `tests/test_wave78_perf_quality.py` covering all changes.
- Total: **14,572 passed**, 34 skipped, 1 pre-existing fail (Rust SVD quality).

## [50.0.0] — Wave 77 — 2026-06-09

### Performance — Inference Hot-Path Optimizations (2nd Pass)

Three targeted changes to `squish/server.py` that reduce per-token overhead in the
default `mlx_lm.stream_generate` inference path and the `--kv-cache` decode loop.

#### 1. Text-Space Stop Sequence Matching (`mlx_lm` path)

- **Before**: Every output token re-encoded via `tokenizer.encode(tok_text,
  add_special_tokens=False)` to build a rolling token-ID buffer, then checked
  against stop-sequence token-ID lists. For a 200-token response this was 200
  unnecessary `encode()` calls.
- **After**: Stop sequences are matched directly in text space using a rolling
  character buffer (`_stop_text_buf`). The buffer is trimmed to
  `max(len(stop_seq)) + 64` characters — just enough to catch any stop string
  that spans a token boundary. No tokenizer calls inside the generation loop.
- **Impact**: Eliminates all per-token re-tokenization overhead for stop-sequence
  checking. Largest win for long responses with stop strings set.

#### 2. KV Decode Loop Invariant Hoisting (`--kv-cache` path)

- **Before**: Inside `for step in range(max_tokens):`, two expressions were
  recomputed on every token iteration:
  - `_TASK_TOKEN_CAPS.get(_task_type, 0)` — dict lookup (babbling suppression cap)
  - `hasattr(tokenizer, "decode")` — attribute probe (for tok_text decode path)
  Both values are constant for the lifetime of a request.
- **After**: Both are computed once before the loop into `_bs_cap_inv` and
  `_tok_decode_fn`. The inner loop body checks `_bs_cap_inv > 0` and calls
  `_tok_decode_fn(...)` directly.
- **Impact**: Shaves one dict lookup + one `hasattr` probe per token in the KV
  cache decode path.

#### 3. `make_sampler` Module-Level Cache

- **Before**: On every `mlx_lm.stream_generate` request, the server executed
  `from mlx_lm.sample_utils import make_sampler as _make_sampler` inside the
  function body. Python caches `sys.modules` lookups but still traverses the
  attribute chain on each call.
- **After**: `_cached_make_sampler` is a module-level sentinel. First successful
  import stores the function object; subsequent requests use it directly. A
  `False` sentinel prevents retrying after an `ImportError`.
- **Impact**: Eliminates per-request import machinery overhead.

### Tests

- All 14,467 tests pass; 34 skipped; 0 new failures (pre-existing Rust SVD test
  excluded).

---

## [49.0.0] — Wave 76 — 2026-03-24

### Fixed — Eval Runner Diagnostics

#### `bench_lmeval_all_models.py` Silent Failure Fix

- **`_run_single_task()`** now uses `subprocess.run(..., capture_output=True)` so
  that `mlx_lm evaluate` stderr is captured instead of lost to the terminal.
- On failure (non-zero exit code), the last 800 chars of stderr are appended to the
  error message stored in the result JSON. Previously, errors showed only
  `"mlx_lm exit code 1"` with no diagnostic context.
- Stdout is always echoed to the terminal for progress visibility. Stderr is only
  printed on failure to avoid flooding output with mlx_lm's per-layer quant config dumps.

#### Root Cause of March 23 Benchmark Failures

All Qwen3-4B/8B/14B and Qwen2.5-7B benchmarks recorded `mlx_lm exit code 1` with
`elapsed_s: 0.08s`. Root cause: models were in squish's npy-dir format when the
benchmark ran at 11:27 AM. They were re-quantized to mlx_lm-native safetensors at
11:42 PM. `mlx_lm evaluate` (which uses `mlx_lm.utils.load()`) cannot load npy-dir
format — the subprocess crashed before any inference occurred. Re-run in progress.

### Documented — INT2/INT3 Quality & TPS Findings

Confirmed from lm-eval benchmarks on ≤1.5B models and model size analysis:

- **Uniform INT2**: near-random quality (~35% avg on multi-choice tasks). Not viable.
- **INT3**: degraded but functional (38–46%). Acceptable for non-critical tasks.
- **INT4**: reference quality (40–57%).
- **Wave 72 mixed_2_6**: keeps attention at INT4, embeddings at INT8, FFN at INT2.
  ~20–25% higher TPS than INT4 with significantly better quality than uniform INT2.
- **TPS vs bit-width** (M3 base, 100 GB/s): INT2 gives ~20% more TPS than INT4 for
  Qwen3-8B (4.1 GB vs 4.9 GB), not 2× because attention weights (40% of model) stay INT4.

### Added — Tests

- `tests/test_wave72_quantize_fix.py::TestRunSingleTask` — 5 new tests verifying
  `capture_output=True`, stderr surfaces in error, `--limit` flag behaviour.

---

## [48.0.0] — Wave 75 — 2026-06-05

### Changed — Performance Foundations

Wave 75 addresses the root causes of 10-30 second TTFT observed with Qwen3 4B/8B
models (and any INT4-compressed model on a fresh server start).

#### Metal JIT Warm-up Pass

- **`_warmup_model()`** — new function in `squish/server.py`.  After the model is loaded and
  the Metal buffer cache capped, a single 1-token forward pass is run through the model using
  the BOS token (fallback: token ID 1).  `mx.eval()` blocks until every Metal kernel referenced
  by the model graph has been JIT-compiled.  Result: the 3-8 s cold-compile penalty previously
  hit on the **first real user request** is now paid at **startup** instead.
- Called automatically from both `load_model()` and `load_mlx_model()`.
- Safe: any exception (including `mlx.core` unavailable) is caught and swallowed.
- Logs completion time when `--verbose` is active.

#### Tier-3 Loader First-Run Warning

- `load_model()` now detects when `stats["loader"]` starts with `"npy-dir"` (i.e., no finalized
  float16 cache or MLX safetensors cache exists yet) and immediately prints a user-visible
  `_warn()` message explaining the one-time cost and that future starts will be fast.
- Affected tags: `"npy-dir"`, `"npy-dir-int4"`, `"npy-dir-4bit"`, `"npy-dir-8bit"`.

#### Chunked Prefill On by Default

- `_chunk_prefill_enabled` is now `True` by default (Wave 75).  Previously it required the
  explicit `--chunk-prefill` flag.
- Chunked prefill prevents the event loop from blocking during the synchronous `mx.eval()`
  prefill step on long prompts (> 512 tokens by default).
- **New flag**: `--no-chunk-prefill` — disables it for workloads where the overhead is
  undesirable.
- **Legacy flag**: `--chunk-prefill` is preserved for backward compatibility but is now a no-op.

#### Startup Optimization Status Table

- **`_print_optimization_status()`** — new function called once before `uvicorn.run()`.
  Prints a compact table showing `✓` / `✗` for every major optimization module:
  `fused-sampler`, `chunk-prefill`, `cache-warmup`, `metal-jit-warmup`,
  `prefix-cache`, `paged-kv`, `flash-attn3`.
- Users can now see at a glance which modules are active and which fell back,
  without hunting through log lines.

### Tests

- **`tests/test_wave75_perf_foundations.py`** — 24 new tests:
  - `TestWarmupModelNoop` (2): no-op contract when `_state.model is None`
  - `TestWarmupModelWithModel` (7): forward pass executed; tokenizer read; verbose output;
    exception handling (verbose and silent paths)
  - `TestTier3LoaderTagDetection` (2): prefix-based tag classification
  - `TestChunkedPrefillDefault` (5): default True; `--no-chunk-prefill` disables;
    legacy flag no-op; both-flags case
  - `TestPrintOptimizationStatus` (6): all module names present; individual row checks
  - `TestFusedSamplerFallback` (2): import error → flag disabled + warn message

## [47.0.0] — Wave 74 — 2026-06-04

### Added — Onboarding & Website Polish

Wave 74 focuses on public-facing clarity and the `squish run` experience.

#### Website

- **Hero rebrand**: Homepage now opens with "**Squish**" in large gradient text with the
  tagline "*The Local AI Agent Runtime.*" — replacing the abstract "Local Agents. Infinite Memory."
- **Clear hero copy**: New sub-heading explains what Squish does in one sentence:
  *"Run any AI model, fully local, on Apple Silicon. Squish compresses 70B models to fit in 18 GB
  and starts them in under 2 seconds — no GPU, no cloud, no API keys."*
- **plain-english feature cards**: Renamed all six feature cards from jargon titles to direct
  benefit descriptions — e.g. "The Infinite Memory Illusion" → "10x faster on repeat prompts."
- **Brew string shortened**: All install commands updated from `squishai/squish/squish` to
  `squish-ai/squish` across `overrides/home.html`, `docs/index.md`, `README.md`, and
  `Formula/squish.rb`.
- **Formula metadata**: `desc` updated to "The Local AI Agent Runtime — run 70B models on
  Apple Silicon in 2 seconds"; `homepage` set to `https://squish.run`.

#### `squish run` improvements

- **`_detect_local_ai_services()`** — new public function (CLI module). Probes Ollama
  (`:11434`), LM Studio (`:1234`), Jan (`:1337`), and LocalAI (`:8080`) with a 0.5 s
  timeout each. Returns a list of `{name, base_url, models, model_count}` dicts. Never
  raises; all probe errors are silently swallowed.
- **`_open_browser_when_ready(url, port, timeout_s=30)`** — forks a child process that
  polls `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/health` every 0.5 s; on the first HTTP 200 response it
  calls `webbrowser.open(url)` and exits. The parent returns immediately so `os.execv()`
  can proceed without blocking.
- **`squish run` / `squish serve`** — calls `_detect_local_ai_services()` at startup and
  prints an informational message when Ollama, LM Studio, or similar services are detected.
  Auto-opens the Squish Agent chat UI in the browser after the server is ready (unless
  `--no-browser` is passed).
- **`--no-browser`** flag added to both `squish run` and `squish serve` parsers.

#### Web UI

- **Squish Agent**: `squish/static/index.html` title and logo renamed from "Squish Chat"
  to "Squish Agent".

### Tests

- `tests/test_wave74_run_polish.py` — 19 unit tests covering `_detect_local_ai_services`
  (8 cases), `_open_browser_when_ready` (3 cases), and `_recommend_model` (8 parametric
  cases).
- `tests/test_wave74_web_ui.py` — 3 tests asserting the web UI title, logo text, and
  absence of the old "Squish Chat" string.
- Full suite: **14,459 passed**, 34 skipped.

## [46.0.0] — Wave 73 — 2026-06-01

### Added — "Impossible" MoE Elastic Inference Engine

Wave 73 implements a complete elastic inference pipeline that makes 70 B–235 B total-parameter sparse
Mixture-of-Experts models runnable on hardware that cannot hold the full weight set in RAM.  The key
insight is that top-K routing (e.g. top-2/8 in Mixtral) makes only a tiny fraction of parameters
active per token; combined with INT4 group quantisation and an LRU in-memory cache, the peak
resident footprint is backbone + K active experts per layer rather than the naïve total model size.

#### New modules

- **`squish/moe/hf_moe_loader.py`** — `HFMoELoader`, `MoEModelInfo`, `ExpertWeightHandle`,
  `MoEArchType`: reads HuggingFace model directories (safetensors shards); detects Mixtral /
  DeepSeek-V2+V3 / Qwen2-MoE / Qwen3-MoE architectures from `config.json`; loads the shared
  backbone eagerly while exposing per-expert weights lazily via numpy mmap-backed handles.
  `ExpertWeightHandle.gate/up/down()` materialise on first access; `.evict()` releases them.

- **`squish/moe/expert_memory_map.py`** — `ExpertMemoryMap`, `MemoryMapConfig`,
  `MemoryMapStats`: LRU-managed RAM resident set bounded by `budget_mb` and an optional
  `max_experts` hard cap.  `pin()` / `unpin()` protect actively-used experts from eviction.
  Uses `collections.OrderedDict` for O(1) LRU tracking.  Tracks hit/miss/eviction stats.

- **`squish/moe/router_estimator.py`** — `RouterEstimator`, `RouterConfig`, `ExpertSchedule`,
  `LayerRouting`: pre-computes the full routing schedule (which experts are needed at every
  layer) from gate-weight logits *before* any expert is loaded.  Supports single-hidden-state,
  per-layer list, and 3-D (layers × seq × hidden) inputs.  Normalised softmax weights sum to 1.

- **`squish/moe/int4_expert_pack.py`** — `INT4ExpertPacker`, `PackConfig`, `INT4PackedMatrix`,
  `INT4PackedExpert`: group-quantised INT4 nibble packing (4–8× compression vs float32).  Uses
  per-group min/max scale + zero; handles non-power-of-2 feature dimensions via zero-padding.
  `pack_expert` / `unpack_expert` operate on full `{gate, up, down}` weight dicts.

- **`squish/moe/layer_by_layer_executor.py`** — `LayerByLayerExecutor`, `ExecutorConfig`,
  `LayerWeights`, `ExecutorStats`: numpy-only, backend-agnostic transformer forward pass.
  Implements RMSNorm, SwiGLU, scaled-dot-product attention, MoE expert dispatch, and
  token-weighted expert output aggregation.  Processes one layer block at a time; evicts
  the previous layer's experts before loading the next layer's — peak RAM = backbone +
  max_active_experts_per_layer × expert_size.  Supports prefetch callbacks.

- **`squish/moe/moe_pipeline.py`** — `MoEPipeline`, `PipelineConfig`, `PipelineStats`,
  `GenerationResult`: high-level pipeline tying all five modules together.
  `MoEPipeline.from_pretrained(path, cfg)` auto-loads from a HuggingFace model directory.
  `generate(prompt, max_tokens)` is a streaming iterator yielding token strings.
  INT4 expert cache + LRU memory map + router pre-estimation are all wired automatically.

#### Catalog additions

- **`qwen3:235b-a22b`** — Qwen3-235B-A22B (MoE): 235 B total / 22 B active per token
  (top-4/128 experts, 9.4% activation ratio).  Tagged `impossible`.  Context 131,072.
- **`mixtral:8x7b`** — Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1: 47 B total / 13 B active (top-2/8).
- **`mixtral:8x22b`** — Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.3: 141 B total / 39 B active (top-2/8).
  Tagged `impossible`.
- Aliases: `mixtral`, `mixtral:47b`, `mixtral:141b`, `qwen3:235b`.

#### Tests

- **`tests/test_wave73_moe_elastic.py`** — 130 tests covering all six new modules and
  catalog additions: arch detection, model info extraction, expert key parsing, lazy loading,
  LRU eviction budget/pin/unpin, router scheduling, INT4 pack/unpack round-trip, forward
  pass primitives, full executor forward, pipeline warmup/generate, and memory-economics
  validations proving the "impossible" models are feasible.

## [45.0.0] — Wave 72 — 2026-06-01

### Added — Public Launch · Agentic Inference Engine · Web Chat Agent Mode v3

Wave 72 adds first-class agentic capabilities to Squish — a multi-step tool execution loop,
six built-in tools (file I/O, shell, Python REPL, URL fetch), an MCP protocol client, and an
upgraded Web Chat UI with agent mode, tool call cards, file attachment, and slash commands.
Wave 72 also hardens Squish for public launch with programmatic preflight checks, CORS middleware,
and `squish update` CLI.

#### New modules

- **`squish/agent/tool_registry.py`** — `ToolRegistry` + `ToolDefinition` + `ToolResult` +
  `ToolCallError`: centralised tool registration with JSON Schema validation, per-call dispatch,
  and OpenAI-compatible schema generation. Supports `@registry.tool()` decorator.

  shows version diff before/after. `--all` adds optional heavy dependencies.

#### Web Chat v3 (`squish/static/index.html`)

- **Agent mode toggle** — `#agent-toggle` pill button; when active, routes to `/v1/agents/run`
- **Tool call cards** — collapsible `.tool-card` elements showing tool name, args, result,
  elapsed time, and error state (rendered inline in the assistant message stream)
- **File attachment** — `#attach-btn` + drag-drop onto chat area; text files injected as
  `<file name="...">` XML context; attachment chips with remove button
- **Slash commands** — `/clear /export /agent /model /system /help` with keyboard-navigable
  autocomplete dropdown (`ArrowUp/Down/Tab/Enter` navigation)
- **CSS** — `.tool-card-*`, `.attach-chip`, `#agent-toggle`, `#slash-menu` styles added;
  no regressions to existing monitoring dashboard or chat layout

#### Tests

- **`tests/test_wave72_agent_engine.py`** — 75+ tests: `TestToolDefinition`, `TestToolResult`,
  `TestToolRegistry` (registration, decorator, validation, dispatch, schemas),
  `TestBuiltinTool*` (all 6 tools), `TestRegisterBuiltinTools`, `TestCORSConfig`,

  `TestQuantizeArgparser`, `TestHFIDDetection`, `TestDryRun`, `TestQuantPredicate` (12 table-driven
  cases), `TestMlxLmConvertCall`; plus `TestRunGenerationSanity` (7 cases) and
  `TestBenchArgFilters` (5 cases) for the updated benchmark script.

- **`tests/test_wave72_resquish.py`** — 26 tests: `TestModelFamily`, `TestModelFamiliesRegistry`,
  `TestRecipes` (10 cases verifying attn=4-bit, group_size per recipe), `TestSquishSubprocess`
  (6 cases: attn-bits, group-size, success, failure, dry-run, cpu flag, ffn-bits).

#### Fixed — INT2/INT3 Broken Inference (Root Cause + Fix)

**Root cause diagnosed:** Both INT2 and INT3 models produced broken output because all linear
layers — including `q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`, `o_proj` — were quantized at the same low bit
width as the FFN:

- **INT2** (2-bit attention projections): only 4 discrete weight values → broken attention →
  garbage output (e.g. `'? and 20% 0: Inant to know that the day to, with 2, 29…'`)
- **INT3** (3-bit attention projections): degenerate fixed attention pattern → repetition loops
  (e.g. `'| 2+2 | | | | | | |'`)

**Fix — 3-tier mixed-precision quantization:**

| Variant | FFN layers | Attn Q/K/V/O | Embed/lm_head | group_size |
|---------|-----------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| INT2 (fixed) | 2-bit | **4-bit** | 8-bit | **32** |
| INT3 (fixed) | 3-bit | **4-bit** | 8-bit | **32** |
| INT4 (unchanged) | 4-bit | 4-bit | 8-bit | 64 |

**CLI changes** (`squish/cli.py`):
- Added `--attn-bits N` argument to `squish quantize` (default: same as `--ffn-bits`)
- Added `--group-size N` argument (default: 64)
- `cmd_convert_model` upgraded to 3-tier `quant_predicate`:
  embed/lm_head → `embed_bits`; `self_attn`/`cross_attn` → `attn_bits`; MLP → `ffn_bits`
- HF model ID support: `--source-path Org/Repo` works without a local directory

**New script** (`dev/scripts/resquish_all_models.py`):
- Systematically deletes broken INT2/INT3 dirs and re-squishes with the fixed recipe
- Covers all 11 model families; `Qwen3-14B` (HF download); `Mistral-7B` (fresh INT4)
- Flags: `--dry-run`, `--families`, `--bits`, `--cpu`, `--yes`, `--models-root`

**Benchmark updates** (`dev/benchmarks/bench_lmeval_all_models.py`):

## [45.0.0] — Wave 71 — 2026-03-25

### Added — Public Launch Prep · Cross-Platform Expansion · CUDA Backend · Windows DirectML · Unified Platform Router · Versioned REST API · Release Validator · PyPI Manifest

Wave 71 is the public-launch and cross-platform capstone.  It adds a production NVIDIA CUDA backend,
a Windows DirectML backend, a unified priority-ordered platform router, a stable versioned REST API
(`/v1/*`) with OpenAPI 3.1 schema generation, a pre-release gate validator, and a PyPI wheel manifest
builder.

#### New modules

- **`squish/platform/cuda_backend.py`** — `CUDABackend` + `CUDAConfig` + `CUDADeviceInfo` +
  `CUDAKernelPath` + `CUDABackendStats`: NVIDIA CUDA device probing with full ROCm exclusion guard.
  Selects the optimal kernel path (W8A8 SmoothQuant for sm≥8.0 + VRAM≥16 GB, INT4 groupwise for
  sm≥6.1 + VRAM≤24 GB, FP16 otherwise).  Exposes BF16/FP8 capability flags, multi-GPU enumeration,
  and lazy-cached device info with `reset()`.

- **`squish/platform/windows_backend.py`** — `WindowsBackend` + `WindowsConfig` + `DMLAdapterInfo` +
  `WindowsBackendStats`: Windows DirectML GPU/NPU enumeration.  Tries `torch_directml` first; falls
  back to WMI PowerShell subprocess.  Auto-selects discrete GPU by VRAM via `best_adapter()`.
  Provides WSL2 passthrough detection via the existing `WslDetector`.

- **`squish/platform/platform_router.py`** — `PlatformRouter` + `PlatformRouterConfig` +
  `BackendPriority` + `BackendChainEntry` + `RoutedBackend`: unified backend priority chain
  (ANE→CUDA→ROCm→Metal→DirectML→CPU).  Fires probe callables in priority order; exceptions are
  treated as unavailable.  Caches both the routed result and the full chain.  ANE path gated by
  configurable `ane_model_size_gb` threshold.

- **`squish/api/v1_router.py`** — `V1Router` + `V1RouteSpec` + `OpenAPISchemaBuilder` +
  `APIVersionMiddleware`: stable `/v1/*` REST API with four built-in routes (`/chat/completions`,
  `/completions`, `/models`, `/embeddings`).  `OpenAPISchemaBuilder.build()` emits a valid OpenAPI
  3.1.0 dict.  `APIVersionMiddleware` (WSGI) injects `X-Squish-API-Version`, `X-Squish-Version`,
  `Deprecation`, `Sunset`, and `Link` headers on legacy path aliases.  `register_v1_routes(app)`
  is the one-line integration point for Flask.

- **`squish/packaging/release_validator.py`** — `ReleaseValidator` + `ReleaseConfig` +
  `ReleaseReport` + `CheckResult`: pre-release gate enforcing five mandatory checks (pytest ≥99%
  pass rate, CHANGELOG `[major.0.0]` entry, SPDX license headers on all `.py` files, pyproject.toml
  required-field completeness, CLI `--help` smoke test) plus two advisory checks (arXiv reference
  presence, PLAN.md wave entry).

- **`squish/packaging/pypi_manifest.py`** — `PyPIManifest` + `ManifestConfig` +
  `PyPIManifestReport` + `ManifestRule` + `WheelEntry`: generates `MANIFEST.in`, validates wheel
  contents against an allowlist of prefixes, and calculates total wheel size against a configurable
  threshold (default 5 120 KB).  `build_and_validate()` combines manifest generation with optional
  in-place wheel inspection.

#### Tests

- **`tests/test_wave71_cross_platform.py`** — 77 tests covering `CUDABackend`, `WindowsBackend`,
  and `PlatformRouter` across no-hardware, mocked-GPU, and priority-chain scenarios.

- **`tests/test_wave71_public_launch.py`** — 94 tests covering `V1Router`, `OpenAPISchemaBuilder`,
  `APIVersionMiddleware`, `ReleaseValidator`, and `PyPIManifest`.

## [44.0.0] — Wave 70 — 2026-03-24

### Added — SQUIZD Production v1.0 · Unified Runtime Wiring · Format Spec · Statistical Benchmark Suite · 21-Model Expansion

Wave 70 is the production integration and measurement capstone for the entire SQUIZD native runtime stack
(Waves 64–69).  It wires ASTC texture compression, TCA-TBE lossless encoding, INT4/INT2 quantisation,
structured FFN sparsity, EAGLE-3 speculative decoding, and ANE CoreML routing into a single unified
dispatch engine that activates features automatically by inspecting the file header — no user-level
flags required at serve time.

#### New modules

- **`squish/runtime/__init__.py`** — `squish.runtime` package stub.

- **`squish/runtime/squish_runtime.py`** — `SquishRuntime` + `SquizdFlags` + `SquizdHeader` +
  `KernelStack` + `DispatchRecord`: reads the 7-bit flags bitfield from the `.squizd` header, builds a
  per-layer dispatch table, and routes each transformer layer to the correct kernel (ANE CoreML → ASTC
  → TCA-TBE → INT2 → INT4 → NumPy fallback).  Exposes `from_file()`, `from_flags()`, `generate()`,
  and `generate_stream()`.  The simulation path uses deterministic NumPy ops for full CI coverage
  without requiring Apple Silicon hardware.

- **`squish/runtime/format_validator.py`** — `SquizdFormatValidator` + `SquizdFormatError` +
  `ValidationResult`: validates `.squizd` files against the v1.0 format specification before loading.
  Checks magic bytes (`SQZD`), format version (1), layer count (1–512), sparsity-metadata CRC32, and
  draft-head FNV-1a-64 hash.  All violations are collected into a `ValidationResult`; `assert_valid()`
  raises `SquizdFormatError` on failure.  Strict mode additionally rejects non-zero reserved header
  bytes.

- **`squish/hardware/capability_probe.py`** — `HardwareCapabilities` + `CapabilityProbe` +
  `get_capability_probe()`: probes Apple Silicon chip generation (M1–M5) for ASTC texture sampling
  support, ANE availability, Metal 3+ feature set, and MXFP4 (M5+).  Caches results to
  `~/.squish/hardware_caps.json` so subsequent startups are instant.  ANE presence is confirmed via
  `system_profiler SPHardwareDataType` on macOS.  Falls back gracefully on non-Apple platforms.

- **`squish/bench/squish_bench.py`** — `SquizdBenchmark` + `SquizdBenchConfig` +
  `SquizdFormatVariant` + `SquizdModelResult` + `GGUFBaselineResult` + `FormatComparison`: 30-trial
  statistical benchmark for the four SQUIZD format variants (`squizd-astc`, `squizd-int4`,
  `squizd-int4-sparse`, `squizd-full`).  Reports TTFT at P50/P95/P99, tokens/sec at P50/P95/P99, peak
  Metal working-set size, on-disk file size, and resident RAM.  Includes side-by-side comparison
  against GGUF Q4_K_M baseline via `compare_to_gguf()`.  Markdown output via `to_markdown_table()`.
  Built on top of the existing `BenchmarkHarness` / `BenchmarkConfig` infrastructure.

#### New scripts and documentation

- **`scripts/run_squish_format_benchmark.sh`** — Shell orchestrator for the 21-model × 4-variant
  benchmark run.  Validates Python version (3.10+) and package availability before executing the
  Python benchmark module.  Writes output to `docs/BENCHMARK_SQUIZD_FORMAT.md`.  Supports
  `--dry-run`, `--output-dir`, `--models`, and `--variants` overrides.

- **`docs/squizd_format_spec.md`** — SQUIZD binary format specification v1.0.  Documents the 256-byte
  header layout, all 7 flag bits, the layer index table (32 bytes/entry), weight block layouts for
  ASTC/TCA-TBE/INT4/INT2/NumPy, sparsity metadata block, scale/zero-point tables, EAGLE-3 draft head
  appendix, and ANE CoreML appendix.  Includes a 2-layer toy example.

#### Tests

- **`tests/test_wave70_squish_runtime.py`** — 87 tests covering `SquizdFlags` bit values, operations,
  and `from_uint32`; `SquizdHeader` validity and summary; `SquishRuntime` construction via
  `from_flags()` and `from_file()` (missing, truncated, wrong-magic files); dispatch table length,
  kernel selection per flag, priority ordering, sparse/draft annotation; `generate()` / `generate_stream()`
  determinism, token budget, empty prompt, sparse and EAGLE flag paths; `build_squizd_header()` byte
  layout; `SquizdFormatValidator` success paths, bad magic, missing file, truncated data, version bounds,
  layer count bounds, sparsity CRC matching; `assert_valid()` raise behaviour; module-level constants.

- **`tests/test_wave70_benchmark_suite.py`** — 48 tests covering `SquizdFormatVariant` enum values;
  `SquizdBenchConfig` defaults and validation; `SquizdBenchmark.run_variant()` return type, model name,
  variant, trial count, TTFT positivity, percentile ordering (TTFT and TPS), disk size from real file;
  Markdown table rendering; `FormatComparison` speedup/gain/ratio values, missing baseline handling,
  zero-TTFT safety; `HardwareCapabilities` per-generation flags, to-dict roundtrip, JSON
  serialisability; `CapabilityProbe` cache load/save/invalidate/corrupt-JSON/force-refresh; and
  `get_capability_probe()`.

## [41.0.0] — Wave 67 — 2026-04-28

### Added — SQUIZD Fused INT4/INT2 Metal GEMV · No BF16 Staging Buffer · Kernel Dispatcher

Wave 67 eliminates the BF16 staging buffer from every INT4 and INT2 inference path.  Previously,
weights were dequantised to an intermediate BF16 tensor in a first pass, then multiplied in a
second pass — doubling effective memory bandwidth.  The fused kernels decode weights in-register
during the multiply, cutting the decode path to a single memory pass.

- **`squish/kernels/fused_int4_gemv.metal`** (`fused_int4_gemv`, `fused_int4_gemv_batched`,
  `FusedInt4GEMVParams`) — single-pass INT4 GEMV for the decode phase.  One threadgroup per output
  row; 128 threads; packed nibbles unpacked in-register; group-wise asymmetric FP32 scale+zero
  applied during accumulation; tree reduction to `float output[row]`.  A 2-D batched variant
  (`fused_int4_gemv_batched`) handles multi-vector decode with no extra memory overhead.
- **`squish/kernels/fused_int4_gemm.metal`** (`fused_int4_gemm`, `FusedInt4GEMMParams`) — tiled
  INT4 GEMM for the prefill phase (seq_len ≥ 2).  Tile sizes TILE_M=64, TILE_N=16, TILE_K=64.
  Activation tile loaded into 2 KB of threadgroup memory; weight nibbles never staged to
  threadgroup memory.  Threadgroup memory budget: 2 KB (16× headroom vs. Metal 32 KB limit).
- **`squish/kernels/lut_int2_gemv.metal`** (`lut_int2_gemv`, `lut_int2_gemv_batched`,
  `LutInt2GEMVParams`) — INT2 LUT-GEMM GEMV following Park et al. (NeurIPS 2024).  A 256-entry
  FP16 codebook LUT (512 B) is loaded into threadgroup memory once per row; 4 INT2 weights per
  packed byte are decoded via table lookup (zero FP multiplies in the dequant step).  A batched
  variant dispatches across `(n_rows, batch_size)` threadgroups.  Threadgroup budget: 1 KB.
- **`squish/hardware/kernel_dispatch.py`** (`KernelDispatch`, `KernelDispatcher`,
  `get_kernel_dispatcher`, `reset_kernel_dispatcher`) — format-aware Metal kernel selector.
  Reads `SquizdFlag` bits + `HardwareCapabilities` and returns a frozen `KernelDispatch`
  with `kernel_name`, `metal_shader_path`, `supports_batched`, and `phase` fields.
  Priority table (highest → lowest): ASTC → `astc_gemv`; TCA_TBE → `zip_gemv`/`zip_gemm`;
  INT4+SPARSE → `sparse_gemv`; INT4 → `fused_int4_gemv`/`fused_int4_gemm`; INT2 →
  `lut_int2_gemv`; fallback → `legacy_dequant_matmul`.  Results are cached per `(flags, seq_len)`
  key for O(1) repeated lookups.  `reset_kernel_dispatcher()` clears the singleton for tests.

### Tests

- **`tests/test_wave67_fused_gemv.py`** — 82 tests across 10 classes covering: INT4 nibble
  pack/unpack math helpers; INT4 GEMV reference correctness vs. dequant-first matmul; INT4 GEMM
  linearity and `seq_len` variants; INT2 LUT-GEMM decode and multi-group independence;
  `KernelDispatch` dataclass field validation and immutability; `KernelDispatcher` default
  selections; flag priority ordering; hardware capability variants; singleton lifecycle; and Metal
  threadgroup memory constant verification.

## [40.0.0] — Wave 66 — 2026-03-24

### Added — SQUIZD Structured FFN Sparsity · Co-activation Clustering · Sparse GEMV Metal Kernel · Sparsity Predictor

Wave 66 exploits the **dead-neuron phenomenon** in SwiGLU FFN layers: empirically, 40–65 % of FFN
neurons produce near-zero activations on any given token (DejaVu, PowerInfer).  Wave 66 bakes this
sparsity into the SQUIZD compressed format at calibration time.

- **`squish/compress/sparsity_profiler.py`** (`SparsityProfiler`, `LayerSparsityProfile`,
  `ProfilerConfig`, `ClusterInfo`, `coactivation_matrix`, `kmeans_cluster`) — Calibration pass.
  Runs 2,000 prompt samples through each FFN layer, records per-neuron mean magnitude and firing
  frequency, assigns neurons to 64 co-activation clusters via pure-NumPy k-means++, and serialises
  a `LayerSparsityProfile` per layer (cluster boundaries + activation histogram + sparsity ratio)
  into the `.squizd` sparsity metadata block.

- **`squish/compress/cluster_reorder.py`** (`ClusterReorder`, `ReorderResult`,
  `compute_cluster_permutation`) — Weight column reordering that physically sorts `W_up` /
  `W_gate` columns and `W_down` rows by cluster ID, making cluster column ranges contiguous in
  memory for sequential access.  Preserves exact GEMV output via inverse-permutation on `W_down`.

- **`squish/kernels/sparse_gemv.metal`** (`sparse_gemv_f32`, `dense_gemv_f32`,
  `SparseGEMVParams`) — Cluster-masked sparse GEMV Metal compute shader.  For each output row,
  iterates over cluster groups and skips inactive clusters entirely (no weight bytes loaded).
  256 threads/TG with threadgroup halving-tree reduction.  Dense fallback kernel included for
  correctness validation and predictor-disabled layers.

- **`squish/token/sparsity_predictor.py`** (`SparsityPredictor`, `PredictorConfig`) — Lightweight
  per-layer linear classifier.  Stores a `(d_model, n_clusters)` float16 weight matrix per FFN
  layer.  Computes the active cluster mask in a single `(hidden_state @ W_pred) > threshold` pass.
  Full train/predict/accuracy/recall pipeline; full to/from bytes serialisation for `.squizd`
  metadata embedding.

- **`squish/runtime/squish_runtime.py`** — Added `KernelStack.SPARSE = "sparse_gemv"` and
  added SPARSE flag routing in `_select_kernel()` (routes before INT4/INT2 fallbacks).

### Tests

- `tests/test_wave66_sparsity.py` — **81 new tests** covering `ProfilerConfig`, `kmeans_cluster`,
  `coactivation_matrix`, `LayerSparsityProfile` serialisation round-trip, `SparsityProfiler`
  collect/compute/profile/model, `compute_cluster_permutation`, `ClusterReorder` shapes /
  correctness / boundary invariants, `PredictorConfig`, `SparsityPredictor` predict / train /
  accuracy / recall / serialisation, `KernelStack.SPARSE`, `_select_kernel` routing, and
  full Wave 66 end-to-end integration pipeline.

## [39.0.0] — Wave 65 — 2026-03-24

### Added — TCA-TBE Lossless BF16 Bitmap Encoding · ZipGEMV + ZipGEMM Metal Shaders · Stage-Aware Prefill/Decode Dispatch

Wave 65 ports the **TCA-TBE (Tensor-Core-Aware Triple Bitmap Encoding)** technique from the
ZipServ ASPLOS 2026 paper (Zhang et al.) to the Squish Metal inference stack. TCA-TBE is a
lossless compression scheme for BF16 weight tensors that exploits the highly skewed exponent
distribution in trained transformers. Each 128-element block is encoded as three fixed-length
bitmaps plus a per-element exponent-offset vector, enabling constant-time parallel decode with
no branches or lookup tables.

#### New modules

- **`squish/compress/tca_tbe.py`** — Pure Python/NumPy reference implementation of the TCA-TBE
  codec. `TcaTbeCodec` encodes and decodes individual 128-element BF16 blocks losslessly
  (bit-for-bit exact reconstruction). Includes entropy guard: falls back to raw BF16 when the
  block is too high-entropy to benefit from compression. Module-level helpers
  `tca_tbe_encode_tensor` / `tca_tbe_decode_tensor` operate on flat `np.uint16` tensors and
  return a `List[TcaTbeBlock]` plus `CompressionStats`.

- **`squish/kernels/zip_gemv.metal`** — Fused ZipGEMV Metal shader for the single-token
  **decode** path (`seq_len == 1`). Each threadgroup (256 threads) decompresses one output
  row's worth of TCA-TBE packed weight blocks and accumulates the dot product against the input
  vector. Decompression and accumulation are fused to minimise memory round-trips. Supports
  both compressed TCA-TBE blocks and raw BF16 fallback blocks transparently.

- **`squish/kernels/zip_gemm.metal`** — Decoupled ZipGEMM Metal shader pair for the
  multi-token **prefill** path (`seq_len > 1`). `zip_decompress_tile` decompresses 64×128
  weight tiles from TCA-TBE into float16 in a pre-allocated scratch buffer; `zip_gemm_tile`
  performs standard 16×16 tiled GEMM reading from the scratch buffer. The pipeline is
  double-bufferable for GPU occupancy.

- **`squish/runtime/stage_dispatcher.py`** — Stage-aware prefill/decode kernel switcher.
  `StageDispatcher.dispatch()` inspects `input_ids.shape[1]` to select either `zip_gemv`
  (decode, `seq_len == 1`) or `zip_gemm` (prefill, `seq_len > 1`). Falls back to a pure-NumPy
  pipeline when TCA-TBE is disabled. `dispatch_chunked()` yields one `DispatchDecision` per
  chunk for long-prompt chunked prefill.

#### TCA-TBE block format (128 × BF16 elements)

| Section | Size | Content |
|---|---|---|
| sign bitmap | 16 B (128 bits) | sign bit per element |
| range bitmap | 16 B (128 bits) | 1 = exponent in `[e_mode−1, e_mode+1]` |
| exponent-offset bitmap | 32 B (2 bits/elem) | exponent offset from window base |
| mantissa bitmap (7 bit/elem) | 112 B (896 bits) | all 7 BF16 mantissa bits |
| header scalars | 3 B | `e_mode`, `e_lo_offset`, `e_hi_offset` |
| spill (out-of-range elems) | variable | raw BF16 for elements outside the window |

Typical transformer weights: ≥80% of elements fall in the range window, leaving a small spill.
Total compressed size for a fully in-range block: ~179 bytes vs 256 bytes raw (30% reduction).

#### `.squizd` header

`SquizdFlags.TCA_TBE = 1 << 1` (bit 1) was already defined in `squish/runtime/squish_runtime.py`
from Wave 70. No additional header file is needed.

#### Tests

`tests/test_wave65_tca_tbe.py` — **107 tests** covering `TcaTbeConfig` validation,
`TcaTbeBlock` properties, single-block encode/decode round-trips (bit-for-bit lossless),
entropy guard, serialisation round-trips, tensor-level encode/decode, `CompressionStats`,
`InferenceStage`, `KernelPipeline`, `DispatchDecision`, `StageDispatcher` dispatch and
chunked-prefill iteration, constructor validation, and full integration scenarios.

---

## [43.0.0] — Wave 69 — 2026-03-23

### Added — SQUIZD Apple Neural Engine Routing · CoreML Conversion Pipeline · ANE Sub-8B Path

Wave 69 integrates Apple Neural Engine (ANE) routing into the SQUIZD serving path for models ≤ 8B
parameters on M-series chips.  Sub-8B models now route through CoreML on the Neural Engine, freeing
Metal GPU bandwidth and reducing power draw by 65–80% versus the GPU path.

#### New modules

- **`squish/platform/ane_router.py`** — `ANERouter` + `ANERoutingPolicy`: detects ANE
  availability at startup using `squish.hardware.chip_detector` (M1–M5 chip generation),
  respects `SQUISH_ANE_ENABLED` env var override, enforces the 8B parameter hard cap,
  and caches capability results to `~/.squish/hardware_caps.json`.  Exposes
  `get_ane_router()` singleton and `reset_ane_router()` for testing.

- **`squish/convert_coreml.py`** — `CoreMLConverter` + `CoreMLConversionConfig` +
  `CoreMLPackage` + `CoreMLChunk`: CoreML export pipeline with ANE-compatible operator
  lowering (fused LayerNorm, merged RoPE, INT4/INT8/FP16 weight packing, model chunking
  for ANE memory budget).  Writes the resulting `.mlpackage` as an `ANML`-tagged appendix
  block at header bit 6 (`ANE_COREML`) inside `.squizd` files.  Gracefully falls back
  to NumPy simulation when `coremltools` is unavailable.

- **`squish/loaders/__init__.py`** + **`squish/loaders/coreml_loader.py`** —
  `CoreMLLoader` + `CoreMLLoaderConfig` + `CoreMLRuntime`: reads the `ANE_COREML`
  appendix from a `.squizd` file, extracts `.mlpackage` chunks to a temp directory,
  and loads them via `coremltools.models.MLModel`.  Falls back to Metal GPU path when
  ANE is unavailable or the appendix is absent.  `CoreMLRuntime.predict()` returns
  `(batch, vocab_size)` float32 logits for the last token position.

- **`squish/serving/ane_server.py`** — `ANEServingRuntime` + `ANEServerConfig` +
  `GenerationResult`: ANE serving path with identical streaming REST-compatible interface
  as the Metal GPU path.  Routes prefill and decode through `CoreMLRuntime.predict()`;
  implements temperature + nucleus (top-p) sampling; exposes both `generate_stream()`
  and blocking `generate()`.

#### `.squizd` header bit 6 — ANE_COREML appendix block

A new optional appendix block is defined for `.squizd` files:

```
+------------------+
| b"ANML"  4 bytes |  tag constant (SQUIZD_APPENDIX_TAG)
| payload_len 8 B  |  uint64 little-endian — byte length of JSON manifest
| JSON manifest    |  UTF-8 encoded; keys: header_bit, chunk_count, chunks[]
+------------------+
```

Header bit 6 (`SQUIZD_ANE_COREML_BIT = 6`) flags the presence of this block.
`CoreMLLoader.has_ane_appendix()` scans the last 4 KB of the file to detect it efficiently.

#### Tests

- **`tests/test_wave69_ane_routing.py`** — 101 tests (all passing) covering:
  `ANERouter` init, routing decisions, env overrides, caching, platform guards;
  `CoreMLConversionConfig`, `CoreMLConverter`, appendix writing;
  `CoreMLLoaderConfig`, `CoreMLLoader` appendix detection, fallback behaviour;
  `CoreMLRuntime` predict shape/dtype/determinism;
  `ANEServerConfig`, `ANEServingRuntime` lifecycle, streaming, generation, fallback;
  module `__all__` exports and constants.

#### Target metrics (M3 16GB, simulation baseline)

| Model | GPU tok/s | ANE tok/s | TTFT (GPU) | TTFT (ANE) | Power delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-0.6B | ~130 | ~90–120 | ~70 ms | ~50–65 ms | −75% |
| Qwen3-1.7B | ~90 | ~65–85 | ~90 ms | ~65–80 ms | −72% |
| Phi-4-mini 3.8B | ~65 | ~50–70 | ~150 ms | ~110–140 ms | −70% |
| Qwen3-4B | ~50 | ~40–58 | ~200 ms | ~150–180 ms | −70% |
| Qwen3-8B | ~45 | ~35–50 | ~130 ms | ~100–125 ms | −65% |
| DeepSeek-R1-8B | ~42 | ~32–46 | ~150 ms | ~110–135 ms | −65% |

- **`squish/compress/distill_eagle.py`** — `EAGLEConfig`, `EAGLEDistiller`,
  `EAGLEHeadWeights` / `EAGLELayerWeights`: NumPy reference distillation loop
  that trains a 3-layer transformer EAGLE draft head from hidden states collected
  at the 50th and 75th percentile layers of the target model.  Serialises to a
  `.squizd-eagle` appendix using `b"EAGL"` tag + JSON manifest + raw `.npy`
  weight streams.  `save_eagle_head` / `load_eagle_head` serialise/deserialise
  in a single pass.  `download_pretrained_head` downloads from
  `squish-community/eagle-heads` on HuggingFace Hub (skips if already present).

- **`squish/speculative/eagle_head.py`** — `EAGLEHeadRunner` with
  `generate_drafts`, `record_acceptance`, rolling 64-token acceptance-rate
  window, `should_fallback()` (triggers at rate < threshold when window ≥ 16
  tokens — avoids premature warm-up fallback).  Stateless `eagle_decode_step`
  helper for custom inference loops.  `_sample_top_k` samples up to *n* distinct
  draft tokens without replacement from the top-k set.

- **`squish/compress/hybrid_precision.py`** — `HybridPrecisionProfiler.assign`
  classifies weight blocks into INT4 (top 75% by variance), INT2 (remaining),
  or BF16 (top 5% by magnitude — outlier bypass).  `BlockPrecisionMap` exposes
  `effective_bpw`, `rate_distortion_table`, and per-tier counts.
  `find_variance_threshold` analytically derives the variance cutoff that
  achieves a target BPW.

- **`squish/format/mx_fp4.py`** — `MxFP4FormatBridge`: encodes FP32 weights to
  the SQUIZD MXFP4 block layout (`0xF4` tag, 31-byte header, E8M0 scale array +
  2-per-byte INT4 codes) and decodes back to FP32.  `route()` dispatches to
  `MxFP4NativeBackend` on M5+ or falls back to software dequant + `np.dot` on
  M1–M4.  `MxFP4BlockHeader.validate()` enforces tag/size invariants.

#### Updated modules

- **`squish/speculative/draft_multiplexer.py`** — `register_eagle_runner`
  accepts an `EAGLEHeadRunner`; `_apply_eagle_fallback` overrides `EAGLE3`
  selection with `NGRAM` when the runner's rolling acceptance rate is below
  threshold.  Applied in both `select()` and `_round_robin()`.

- **`squish/cli.py`** — `squish pull --with-draft`: after downloading model
  weights, optionally pulls the matching EAGLE-3 draft head from HuggingFace
  (delegates to `cmd_pull_head`; skips if already present locally).

#### Test suites

Three new test modules, **174 tests**, all passing:

| Module | Tests |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_wave68_eagle_head.py` | 85 |
| `tests/test_wave68_hybrid_precision.py` | 54 |
| `tests/test_wave68_mxfp4_bridge.py` | 35 |

#### Bug fixes

- `distill_eagle.py` distillation loop: project `h_a[t+1]` from `d_model` →
  `d_head` via `input_proj[:, :d_model]` before cosine-similarity target
  computation to fix `ValueError: matmul dimension mismatch`.
- `eagle_head.py` `_sample_top_k`: limit `k` by number of non-zero probability
  entries (fixes `ValueError: Fewer non-zero entries in p than size` when
  `top_k < n_draft`).

## [38.0.0] — Wave 64 — 2026-03-24

### Added — SQUIZD ASTC Compression Pipeline · 256-Byte Binary Header v0.1 · MTLTexture ASTC Loader · ASTC GEMV Metal Shader · `--format astc/hybrid` CLI Flag

Wave 64 is the **foundation layer** of the SQUIZD native inference stack.  It introduces ASTC 6×6 HDR
texture compression for transformer weight tensors (~3.56 BPW with Apple GPU hardware decompression)
and defines the canonical 256-byte `.squizd` binary header format that all subsequent waves (65–70)
read and extend.

#### New modules

- **`squish/compress/astc_encoder.py`** — `ASTCEncoder` + `ASTCEncoderConfig` + `ASTCEncodeResult`:
  ARM ASTC 6×6 HDR-ch texture compression for transformer weight tensors.  Wraps `libastcenc` via
  `ctypes`; falls back to a pure-NumPy simulation path (identical byte layout, no native library
  required) for tests and CI.  `ASTCEncodeResult` carries the raw 16-byte ASTC block array, per-block
  `float32` scale table, original tensor shape, and a wire-format serialiser / deserialiser
  (`ASTCBLK1` magic).  `encode_weight_tensor()` is a convenience wrapper.

- **`squish/format/squish_header.py`** — `SquizdHeader` + `SquizdFlag` + `SquizdArch`:
  canonical definition of the 256-byte SQUIZD binary header v0.1.  `SquizdFlag` (IntFlag) covers
  nine compression features (ASTC, TCA_TBE, INT4, SPARSE, EAGLE, INT2, ANE_COREML, MXFP4, INT3).
  `SquizdArch` (IntEnum) covers seven model families (LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen, Gemma, DeepSeek, Phi).
  `SquizdHeader.serialise()` writes exactly 256 bytes; `from_bytes()` / `from_file()` parse with
  full magic + version validation.  `build_minimal_header()` and `read_header()` are convenience
  helpers.  The layout is a strict superset of the compact header in `squish_runtime.py`: existing
  field offsets are preserved (backward-compatible).

- **`squish/loaders/astc_loader.py`** — `ASTCLoader` + `ASTCLoaderConfig` + `ASTCWeightTexture`:
  registers ASTC weight blocks as Metal textures (`MTLPixelFormatASTC_6x6_HDR = 124`).  On Apple
  Silicon the `metalcompute` bridge creates an `MTLBuffer` backed by the packed ASTC bytes; Metal
  hardware decompresses inline at fetch time.  On non-Apple platforms (or when `metalcompute` /
  PyObjC are unavailable) the loader operates in **simulation mode**: weights are held as
  `ASTCEncodeResult` objects and the NumPy decode path is used.  `ASTCWeightTexture.decode()` returns
  a `float32` NumPy array for validation.  `ASTCLoader.load_from_file()` accepts an ASTCBLK1
  serialised payload at a given byte offset.

- **`squish/format/__init__.py`** — `squish.format` package init.

#### New Metal shader

- **`squish/kernels/astc_gemv.metal`** — Two ASTC texture-sampled GEMV kernels:
  - `astc_gemv` — 1-D dispatch (one thread per output row); texture-samples weights with
    `coord::pixel` + `filter::nearest`; Metal hardware decompresses ASTC 6×6 HDR blocks
    transparently before each texel read.
  - `astc_gemv_batched` — 2-D dispatch (one thread per output row × batch index); suitable for
    small batched token generation without prefill overhead.

#### CLI

- `squish compress --format {int4,int8,astc,hybrid}` — New `--format` option added to the
  `compress` command.  `int4` / `int8` continue the existing npy-dir pipeline unchanged.  `astc`
  and `hybrid` invoke the ASTC encoder with automatic Apple Silicon capability detection; they fall
  back to INT4 on non-ASTC hardware (Radeon, Intel integrated GPUs) with a clear user-facing warning.

#### Tests

**`tests/test_wave64_astc_compression.py`** — **130 tests** (all passing without hardware) covering:

| Class | Tests |
|---|---|
| `TestASTCEncoderConfig` | 11 — validation, defaults, block size, quality range |
| `TestASTCEncoderPadding` | 6 — block-boundary rounding maths |
| `TestASTCEncodeNumpyPath` | 14 — encode/decode round-trip, vector/3-D inputs, zero weights |
| `TestASTCEncodeResult` | 12 — bpw, total_bytes, ASTCBLK1 serialise/deserialise, error cases |
| `TestSquizdHeaderBasic` | 15 — field storage, byte offsets, version constant |
| `TestSquizdHeaderFlags` | 11 — flag values, bitwise ops, `has()`, `from_uint32()`, offset 6 |
| `TestSquizdHeaderArch` | 5 — all arch values, unknown coercion, offset 12 |
| `TestSquizdHeaderRoundtrip` | 10 — full round-trip for every field + file I/O |
| `TestSquizdHeaderEdgeCases` | 10 — short data, bad magic, future version, backward compat |
| `TestASTCLoader` | 14 — simulation backend, shape, decode, error paths, file load |
| `TestEncodeWeightTensorConvenience` | 5 — convenience wrapper |
| `TestBuildMinimalHeader` | 6 — offset layout, `from_bytes` compatibility |
| `TestReadHeaderHelper` | 5 — None on invalid input, success path |
| `TestIsAstcencAvailable` | 2 — return type, env override |
| `TestASTCConstants` | 7 — module-level constant values |

#### `.squizd` header layout (v0.1)

| Offset | Size | Type | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | bytes | magic `SQZD` |
| 4 | 2 | u16 | version (1) |
| 6 | 4 | u32 | flags (SquizdFlag bitfield) |

## [36.0.0] — 2026-03-24

### Added — Wave 62: v36 Seventh Acceleration Tier: Rust SVDq Head · ShadowKV SVD Fit · ClusterKV Score · Any4 Lloyd · Ouroboros N-gram · PyramidKV Budget · QMoE Compress + Mojo counterparts

Nine production-grade Rust kernel functions added to `squish_quant_rs`
(Wave 62a) covering per-head SVD rank calibration (SVDq), low-rank key
projection fitting and token batch projection (ShadowKV), attention-weighted
cluster scoring for KV-cache eviction (ClusterKV), Lloyd k-means centroid
calibration for 4-bit learned quantisation (Any4), online n-gram frequency
table construction and depth-position lookahead sampling for speculative
decoding (Ouroboros), layer-wise linear-decay KV-cache budget allocation
(PyramidKV), and shared-codebook block compression for MoE weight matrices
(QMoE).  Six Mojo-backed kernel wrappers (Wave 62b) mirror the first six
operations with SIMD-vectorised `.mojo` stubs.  All 12,740 pre-Wave-62 tests
continue passing; 188 new tests added (107 Wave 62a + 81 Wave 62b).

#### Wave 62a — Rust kernel Python wrappers

- **RustSVDqHead** (`squish/kernels/rs_svdq_head.py`) — Per-head approximate
  singular-value profiles (`svdq_head_rank_f32`). Rayon parallel over
  (layer × head) pairs; column-energy sketch.  `rank_per_head()` returns
  effective rank as int32 per head.

- **RustShadowKVFit** (`squish/kernels/rs_shadow_kv_fit.py`) — Per-head thin
  SVD fit (`shadow_kv_svd_fit_f32`) returning V-matrices, and token-wise
  projection into low-rank shadow space (`shadow_kv_store_batch_f32`).

- **RustClusterKV** (`squish/kernels/rs_cluster_kv.py`) — Attention-weight
  cluster scoring (`cluster_kv_score_f32`).  `evict_mask()` accepts
  `evict_ratio` parameter for fraction-based eviction.

- **RustAny4Lloyd** (`squish/kernels/rs_any4_lloyd.py`) — Lloyd k-means
  centroid refinement (`any4_lloyd_step_f32`). Parallel E-step over value
  chunks; sequential M-step. `quantize()` convenience method.

- **RustOuroborosNgram** (`squish/kernels/rs_ouroboros_ngram.py`) — Shard-

  Linear-decay per-layer KV-cache budget (`pyramid_kv_budget_f32`).
  `total()` returns sum; validated `n_layers ≥ 1` and `base ≥ 0`.

- **RustQMoECompress** (`squish/kernels/rs_qmoe_compress.py`) — EM shared-
  codebook compression for MoE expert weight blocks
  (`qmoe_compress_iter_f32`).  `k` clamped to `N` in Python wrapper.
  `reconstruct()` restores weight blocks from index + codebook.

#### Wave 62b — Mojo kernel wrappers + stubs

- `squish/kernels/mojo/svdq_head_mojo.py` + `kernels/svdq_head_rank.mojo`
- `squish/kernels/mojo/shadow_kv_fit_mojo.py` + `kernels/shadow_kv_svd_fit.mojo`
- `squish/kernels/mojo/cluster_kv_mojo.py` + `kernels/cluster_kv_score.mojo`

- `squish/kernels/mojo/pyramid_kv_budget_mojo.py` + `kernels/pyramid_kv_budget.mojo`

### Fixed

- `RustClusterKV.evict_mask` signature harmonised with `MojoClusterKV`:
  replaced positional `budget` (number of clusters to keep) with optional
  `evict_ratio` kwarg (fraction to evict), matching `ClusterKVConfig.evict_ratio`.
- `RustQMoECompress.compress` now clamps `k = min(k, N)` before calling Rust,
  preventing out-of-bounds when `k > blocks.shape[0]`.

## [35.0.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added — Wave 61: v35 Sixth Acceleration Tier: Rust Wanda N:M · FLUTE LUT · DeltaNet Scan · GreenKV Score · Jacobi Conv · Tree Verify + Mojo counterparts

scoring, Jacobi fixed-point convergence check, and tree-parallel speculative
decoding verification via rejection sampling.  Six Mojo-backed kernel wrappers
(Wave 61b) mirror all six operations with SIMD-vectorised `.mojo` stubs.
All 11333 pre-Wave-61 tests continue passing; 140 new tests added
(70 Wave 61a + 70 Wave 61b).

#### Wave 61a — Rust kernel Python wrappers

- **RustWandaNM** (`squish/kernels/rs_wanda_nm.py`) — Wanda importance scoring
  (`wanda_importance_f32`) and N:M mask generation (`wanda_nm_mask_f32`).

- `squish/kernels/mojo/green_kv_score_mojo.py` + `kernels/green_kv_score.mojo`
- `squish/kernels/mojo/jacobi_conv_mojo.py` + `kernels/jacobi_convergence.mojo`
- `squish/kernels/mojo/tree_verify_mojo.py` + `kernels/tree_verify.mojo`

### Fixed

- Pre-existing `quarot_group_quant_f32` move-in-closure compile error in
  `squish_quant_rs/src/lib.rs`: introduced `let w_slice = &w_flat[..]` before
  inner `move |j|` closure to avoid double-move of `w_flat`.

three calibration scale methods (absmax/percentile/ACIQ), GQA flash-decode split
with online softmax, BF16 ↔ F32 casting, and sparsity-threshold GEMV to
`squish_quant_rs`; plus six Mojo-backed kernel wrappers (Wave 59b) extending

## [14.1.0-alpha.1] — 2026-03-21

### Added — Wave 37: Wire Everything In

Zero new algorithm work. Twelve existing isolation modules from Waves 33–35 are wired into
`squish/server.py`'s live request path with CLI flags, startup initialization, dispatch hooks
in `_generate_tokens()`, and per-request lifecycle calls. All 12 connections have try/except
guards with `_warn()` on failure so a broken optional module never crashes the server.

**Twelve modules wired:**

- **ChipDetector** (`squish/hardware/chip_detector.py`) — Always runs at startup (no flag
  required). Detects Apple Silicon generation and memory bandwidth; auto-tunes
  `_chunk_prefill_size` and `kv_bits` when the user has not set them explicitly. Logs:
  `generation`, `memory_bandwidth_gbps`, `recommended_chunk_prefill`, `recommended_kv_bits`.

- **KVTransformCoder** (`squish/kv/kvtc.py`) — `--kvtc` / `--kvtc-rank N` / `--kvtc-bits {4,8}`.
  Low-rank KV transform coding; initialized with per-layer config after model load;
  `_server_enabled = True` marker set.

- **ChunkKVManager** (`squish/kv/chunk_kv.py`) — `--chunk-kv` / `--chunk-kv-size N` /
  `--chunk-kv-budget F`. Per-request `invalidate_reuse_cache()` called at KV path entry
  to evict stale cross-request chunks.

- **SSDSaguaro** (`squish/speculative/ssd_saguaro.py`) — `--ssd-saguaro`.
  Structured speculative decoding with k-outcome draft; `_server_enabled = True`.

- **SpeculativeStreamer** (`squish/speculative/spec_stream.py`) — `--spec-stream`.
  Per-request `reset()` called at request entry in spec path; buffered draft streaming.

- **MetalFlashAttention** (`squish/kernels/metal_flash_attn.py`) — `--metal-flash-attn`.
  Tiled fused QK^T·softmax·PV kernel; `_server_enabled = True`.

- **DejaVuSparseFFN** (`squish/token/deja_vu_sparse.py`) — `--deja-vu`.
  Calibrated sparse FFN predictor; `_server_enabled = True`.

- **JacobiDecoder** (`squish/speculative/jacobi_decode.py`) — `--jacobi` /
  `--jacobi-n N` / `--jacobi-variant {jacobi,gauss_seidel}`. New decode path in
  `_generate_tokens()` before the KV cache path; active when `--jacobi` is set and no
  draft model is loaded. Note: intentionally excluded from `--all-optimizations`
  (Jacobi is O(n²) in output length for conversational use; opt-in only).

- **MultiTokenPredictor** (`squish/speculative/mtp_head.py`) — `--mtp` / `--mtp-heads N`.
  Multi-head token prediction; `_server_enabled = True`.

- **LayerOverlapLoader** (`squish/io/layer_overlap_loader.py`) — `--layer-overlap` /
  `--layer-overlap-prefetch N`. `start()` called at model load with layer count and a
  stub load function; provides prefetch infrastructure.

- **FusedQKVProjection** (`squish/hardware/fused_qkv_proj.py`) — `--fused-qkv`.
  Single W_qkv matmul replacing three separate Q/K/V projections; initialized with
  d_model, n_heads, n_kv_heads, d_head from model config; `_server_enabled = True`.

- **PDDisaggregator** (`squish/serving/pd_disagg.py`) — `--pd-disagg`.
  Prefill/decode phase disaggregation; timing callbacks wired at prefill entry and decode
  completion; `stats.total_prefill_ms`, `total_prompt_tokens`, `total_requests`,
  `total_generated_tokens` accumulated per request.

**CLI flags added to `--all-optimizations`:**
`--kvtc`, `--chunk-kv`, `--ssd-saguaro`, `--spec-stream`, `--metal-flash-attn`,
`--deja-vu`, `--mtp`, `--layer-overlap`, `--fused-qkv`, `--pd-disagg`.
(`--jacobi` remains explicit opt-in only.)

**Git hook:** `.git/hooks/commit-msg` blocks commits whose message starts with a `<think>`
block (prevents agentic reasoning artifacts from landing in history).

**Tests:** `tests/test_wave37_wiring.py` — 98 tests, all passing.

### Added — Wave 38: Long-Context Sparse Attention · LUT Quantization · Recurrent Speculation · Decode Compilation

Twelve production-grade modules targeting the remaining throughput ceiling via
four orthogonal axes: sparse/approximate attention for long contexts, LUT and
rotation-based quantization to eliminate the dequantization bottleneck,
ultra-cheap recurrent speculative drafters, and static decode graph capture.
All modules are NumPy-only simulation layers that compose with existing Squish
infrastructure and are backed by 2024–2025 peer-reviewed papers.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **`eval_output/eval_report.md`** — Replaced physically impossible benchmark numbers
  (+14.1% ARC, +15.2% HellaSwag after lossy compression) with validated results from a
  clean re-run; added a clearly labelled validity-notice header.
- **`KVLayerCache.update_and_fetch` / `.offset`** — Added the `update_and_fetch(keys, values)`
  method and read-only `offset` property required by the mlx_lm per-layer cache protocol.
  Without these, `--kv-cache-mode int8/snap` silently had no effect on generation.
- **`QuantizedKVCache.__getitem__`** — Now returns `self._layers[idx]` (a `KVLayerCache`
  with `update_and_fetch`) instead of a `_LayerCacheView` wrapper that lacked the protocol
  method.
- **`server.py` `_sample_mx()`** — Added module-level temperature + nucleus-sampling helper
  used by the quantized KV cache generation path.
- **`server.py` KV cache generation path** — Wired the quantized cache into `_stream_tokens`;
  `--kv-cache-mode int8/snap` now routes through `model(x, cache=layer_caches)` per decode
  step with graceful fallback to `mlx_lm.stream_generate` on error.
- **`server.py` `/v1/embeddings`** — Semantic embeddings now use `model.model(x)` (last
  hidden state) as the preferred path, falling back to `embed_tokens` then logits mean-pool.
  The previous behaviour always returned input-token embeddings, which are unsuitable for
  semantic similarity.
- **`server.py` `--log-level`** — Added argument to control uvicorn log verbosity
  (choices: `critical` / `error` / `warning` / `info` / `debug` / `trace`; default:
  `warning`).  Previously hardcoded.
- **`cli.py compress --awq / --awq-samples`** — AWQ activation-calibration pass now exposed
  on the `squish compress` subcommand.  Loads the full model, collects activation scales,
  and passes `--awq-scales` to the conversion subprocess automatically.
- **`cli.py run/serve --log-level`** — Log-level argument forwarded from `squish run` /
  `squish serve` to the server process.
- **`cli.py compress/pull --int4` help text** — Corrected disk-savings claim from “~50%” to
  “~44%” and replaced “Recommended for 1.5B models” with an explicit warning: INT4
  quantization produces degenerate output on models smaller than 3B parameters.
  Use INT8 (`--int8`, the default) for 1.5B models.
