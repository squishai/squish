"""Wave 122 regression tests — dead module-level constant purge.

Verifies that the four dead module-level constants removed in Wave 122
are absent from server.py, and that all live constants / infrastructure
they were adjacent to remain intact and untouched.

Dead constants removed (13 lines):
  1. _agent_kv_config definition  (L146 pre-wave)  + orphaned global decl
  2. _SEMANTIC_CACHE_CONFIG dict   (L244 pre-wave)  — 7 lines
  3. _compress_threshold           (L331 pre-wave)  — 1 line
  4. _TTY_ERR                      (L405 pre-wave)  — 1 line

Nothing else changed; test_version.py asserts v9.9.0.
